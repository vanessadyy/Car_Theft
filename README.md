# Fight Against Car Theft: Progress and Challenges 
## A Data-Driven Review of the National Action Plan

## Overview

This repository serves as a reproducible resource for an article exploring the current state of car theft in Toronto, recent government initiatives, and the ongoing challenges in addressing this pervasive issue.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from X.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of the auto-complete tool, ChatGPT. 
I also used ChatGPT for simple debugging and annotating my R scripts.
The entire chat history is available in other/llm_usage/usage.txt.
